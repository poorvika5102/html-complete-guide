    navigation, usability, and accessibility.
  </p>

  <h2>Links</h2>

  <p>
    Anchor elements should have descriptive text that clearly explains where
    the link leads.
  </p>

  <h2>Images</h2>

  <p>
    Images must include meaningful <strong>alt</strong> text to support screen
    readers and improve accessibility.
  </p>
